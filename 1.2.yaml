          ## API Versioning
        We're constantly updating and improving the API, and while we try to ensure backwards compatibility, there's always a chance that we'll introduce a change that affects the way your app works.

        To get around any problems that this might cause, we recommend that you include the Accept header with every API request that you make. This header enables you to target your request to a particular version of the API. It looks like this in HTTP:

        ```text
        Accept: application/vnd.saitowag.api+json;version={version_number}
        ```

        Normally, you set the value of the placeholder to the current version of the API. But if you're troubleshooting your app, and you know that an older version of the API works perfectly, say version 1.0, you'd substitute 1.0 for the placeholder value. The API then handles the request as if it were for version 1.0, and your app goes back to working properly.

        ### Example of an error with invalid `ACCEPT` header.
        The `HTTP status code` in case of an invalid `ACCEPT` header will be `400 Bad Request` and the following response will be returned.
        ```json
          {
            "data": [
              {
                "error_code": "ERR_ACCEPT_HEADER_NOT_VALID",
                "error_message": "Accept header is not valid or not set."
              }
            ]
          }
        ```

        ### Unexpected Error
        If an unexpected error occours, a so called Error General will be returned.
        The `HTTP status code` in case of an invalid `ACCEPT` header will be `500` and the following response will be returned.
        ```json
        {
          "data": [
            {
              "error_code": "ERR_GENERAL",
              "error_message": "An unexpected error has occurred. If this problem persists, please contact our support."
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        ### Invalid Endpoint Error
        Any call to a non-existing API endpoint (i.e. wrong route) will return a response with `HTTP status code` `404`
        and the following response body:
        ```json
        {
          "data": [
            {
              "error_code": "ERR_GENERAL_INVALID_ENDPOINT",
              "error_message": "The requested endpoint does not exist."
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Please, note that this error is returned also when a request parameter, part of a valid route, is not well formed.
        For example, a call to a route that contains a wrong order id (i.e. it does not meet the accepted order id pattern -
        e.g. 123456789PAC instead of PAC123456789) will return the error just mentioned, as the route is considered as badly
        formed.

        In conclusion, please pay special attention to all those routes that have request parameters with specific pattern
        requirements.

        <summary><strong id="query-string-filters">Query String Filters</strong></summary>

        | Operator | Full Name | Description | Example |
        | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
        | eq | Equal | Used to narrow down the result of a query to some specific value, for specified field. It adds the "**=**" symbol to the SQL query. Eg. `{url}?filter[{alias_name}]=eq;11` will result in the following sql: `SELECT {field_name} AS {alias_name} FROM {table_name} WHERE {alias_name} = 11` | integer: `{url}?filter[id]=eq;21`<br>float: `{url}?filter[average]=eq;3.7`<br>string: `{url}?filter[free_text]=eq;apple`<br>Date: `{url}?filter[birthday]=eq;2020-06-03`<br>DateTime: `{url}?filter[created_at]=eq;2020-06-03 14:32:32`<br>boolean: `{url}?filter[is_active]=eq;1`<br> |

        | lt | Less than | Used to reduce fetched values to those less than provided in a query string. It adds the "**<**" symbol to the SQL query. Eg. `{url}?filter[{alias_name}]=lt;11` will result in the following sql: `SELECT {field_name} AS {alias_name} FROM {table_name} WHERE {alias_name} < 11` | integer: `{url}?filter[id]=lt;21`<br>float: `{url}?filter[average]=lt;3.7`<br>Date: `{url}?filter[birthday]=lt;2020-06-03`<br>DateTime: `{url}?filter[created_at]=lt;2020-06-03 14:32:32`<br> |

        | nwc | Not like | Used to find everything but the specified pattern. It adds the **NOT LIKE** keyword to the SQL query. Eg. `{url}?filter[{alias_name}]=nwc;j**n** doe` will result in the following sql: `SELECT {field_name} AS {alias_name} FROM {table_name} WHERE {alias_name} NOT LIKE 'j%n% doe'` | string: `{url}?filter[free_text]=nwc;j**n** doe`<br> |
        | btw | Between | Used to find results containing values between two, specified values. It adds the **BETWEEN** keyword to the SQL query. Eg. `{url}?filter[{alias_name}]=btw;10,20` will result in the following sql: `SELECT {field_name} AS {alias_name} FROM {table_name} WHERE {alias_name} BETWEEN 10 AND 20` | integer: `{url}?filter[id]=btw;21,55`<br>float: `{url}?filter[average]=btw;3.7,6.5`<br>Date: `{url}?filter[birthday]=btw;2020-06-03,2021-10-13`<br>DateTime: `{url}?filter[created_at]=btw;2020-06-03 14:32:32,2020-09-12 17:35:32`<br> |
        | rxp | Regular expression | Used to find results matching the regular expression. It adds the **REGEXP** keyword to the SQL query. Eg. `{url}?filter[{alias_name}]=rxp;j(oh\|a)ne` will result in the following sql: `SELECT {field_name} AS {alias_name} FROM {table_name} WHERE {alias_name} REGEXP 'j(oh\|a)ne?'` | string: `{url}?filter[free_text]=rxp;j(oh\|a)ne?`<br> |
        | null | Is null | Used to find results that values of specified column are set to null. It adds the **IS NULL** keyword to the SQL query. Eg. `{url}?filter[{alias_name}]=null;` will result in the following sql: `SELECT {field_name} AS {alias_name} FROM {table_name} WHERE {alias_name} IS NULL` | integer: `{url}?filter[id]=null;`<br>float: `{url}?filter[average]=null;`<br>string: `{url}?filter[free_text]=null;`<br>Date: `{url}?filter[birthday]=null;`<br>DateTime: `{url}?filter[created_at]=null;`<br>boolean: `{url}?filter[is_active]=null;`<br> |
        | nnull | Is not null | Used to find results that values of specified column are not set to null. It adds the **IS NOT NULL** keyword to the SQL query. Eg. `{url}?filter[{alias_name}]=nnull;` will result in the following sql: `SELECT {field_name} AS {alias_name} FROM {table_name} WHERE {alias_name} IS NOT NULL` | integer: `{url}?filter[id]=nnull;`<br>float: `{url}?filter[average]=nnull;`<br>string: `{url}?filter[free_text]=nnull;`<br>Date: `{url}?filter[birthday]=nnull;`<br>DateTime: `{url}?filter[created_at]=nnull;`<br>boolean: `{url}?filter[is_active]=nnull;`<br> |
        </details>





        ### Additional information
        If you want to filter by multiple columns, you can do that, so `{url}?filter[id]=gt;3&filter[email]=like;**@gmail.com&filter[is_active]=eq;1` is a valid query string.

        <strong>However you are not allowed to use one operator multiple times, for the same column.</strong> So `{url}?filter[id]=gte;3&filter[id]=lte;5` is not going to work and might result in unexpected behavior. You can achieve similar result using `{url}?filter[id]=btw;3,5`.
